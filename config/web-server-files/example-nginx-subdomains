### Wildcard Subdomains in a Parent Folder
#
# Ref: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/server_blocks/#wildcard-subdomains-in-a-parent-folder
#
# This is just a really easy way to keep adding new subdomains,
# or to add new domains automatically when DNS records are pointed
# at the server. Note that I have included FCGI here as well. If you
# want to just serve static files, strip out the FCGI config and
# change the default document to index.html. Rather than creating a
# new vhost.conf file for every domain, just create one of these:

server {
  # Replace this port with the right one for your requirements
  listen 80 default_server;  #could also be 1.2.3.4:80

  # Multiple hostnames separated by spaces.  Replace these as well.
  server_name star.yourdomain.com *.yourdomain.com; # Alternately: _

  root /var/www/html;

  error_page 404 errors/404.html;
  access_log logs/star.yourdomain.com.access.log;

  index index.php index.html index.htm;

  # static file 404's aren't logged and expires header is set to maximum age
  location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|png|js|ico|html)$ {
    access_log off;
    expires max;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_intercept_errors on;
    # By all means use a different server for the fcgi processes if you need to
    fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:YOURFCGIPORTHERE;
  }

  location ~ /\.ht {
    deny  all;
  }
}
